      title: "Animal Classification",
      description: "This project involves the implementation of three different CNN models for animal classification. The goal is to determine which model performs best at predicting the animal type based on an image, using a dataset obtained from Kaggle for training and validation. In addition to testing various models, we also explore the use of image augmentation to assess its impact on the results.",

      title: "Sentence Creation",
      description: "We built a model to suggest possible replacements for masked words in a sentence using a pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face, chosen for its strength in contextual understanding. After researching datasets and models, we found both the BERT model and a suitable dataset on Hugging Face to support our task. Our main challenge was loading an additional dataset to evaluate the model's performance.",
